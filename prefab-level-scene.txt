*** Prefab/Level/Scene system
 * Prefab - resource containing serialized data of a portion of an ECS world (entities & components), as well as serialized systems.
 * Level - "extended" prefab resource, containing per-level information, such as the background color/skybox 
 * Scene - runtime instance of one or multiple levels. Contains the actual ECS world and system instances used for execution of the scene.
 * Scene view - UI element used to display the current scene and handle signals such as user input.
	* Editor view - scene view used for the current editor scene.
	* Player view - scene view used for the current player scene.

*** Editor play mode
When the play mode is entered in editor, editor scene serializes it's world & systems (saving modified levels and prefabs if required),
after which it creates a duplicate scene from the serialized data. This is necessary in order to ensure correct initialization of components
and systems, since a regular copy is likely to leave stale and/or invalid references into the old scene, as such a deep copy via serialization
is preformed. In addition, if the user enables autosave on play, the serialized data would be used to save level and prefab assets.
