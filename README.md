# sekhmet

Sekhmet is an open-source C++20 game engine aiming to provide a relatively low level of entry while leaving a lot of
room for skill ceiling.

### Goals

* Open-source and free to use (full license is WIP).
* Low on external dependencies. No frameworks, but independent libraries are allowed.
* Expose as much functionality to the user as possible. Allow the user to make light customizations of the engine
  without forking the project.
* Follow modern (as of 2022) C++ practices.
* Easy to follow and understand design.
